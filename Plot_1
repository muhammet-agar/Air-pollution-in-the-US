#Question 1
#Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#Read file
summarySCC_PM25 <- readRDS("~/Downloads/exdata_data_NEI_data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")

#Aggregate the needed columns, Emissions and Year into a data frame
aggTotals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,summarySCC_PM25, sum)

#Create a barchart
barplot((aggTotals$Emissions)/10^6, names.arg = aggTotals$year, xlab="Year", ylab="pm2.5 Emissions (10^6)", main="Total pm2.5 Emissions for all US")

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot1.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()



#Question 2
#Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (\color{red}{\verb|fips == "24510"|}fips=="24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

#aggregate the values for Baltimore, Maryland (fips == "24510")
baltimoreOnly <- summarySCC_PM25[summarySCC_PM25$fips=="24510",]
aggTotalsBalti <- aggregate(Emissions ~year, baltimoreOnly, sum)

barplot(aggTotalsBalti$Emissions, names.arg = aggTotalsBalti$year, xlab="Year", ylab="pm2.5 Emissions (Tons)", main="Total pm2.5 Emissions for Baltimore, Maryland")

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot2.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()



#Question 3
#Of the four types of sources indicated by the \color{red}{\verb|type|}type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.



#Question4
#Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

#changed to more meaningful names
NEI <- summarySCC_PM25 
SCC <- source_pm25

#used grepl to everything with coal from SCC into new variable SCCcoal
SCCcoal <- SCC[grepl("coal", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case = T),]

#combined NEI coal and SCC coal 
NEIcoal <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCCcoal$SCC,]

#used aggregate to gather all relevant data
totalCoal <- aggregate(Emissions ~year+type, NEIcoal, sum)

#plot
 ggplot(totalCoal, aes(year, Emissions, col = type)) +
+     geom_line() +
+     geom_point() +
+     ggtitle(expression("Total US" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Coal Emission by Type and Year")) +
+     xlab("Year") +
+     ylab(expression("US " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Coal Emission")) +
+     scale_colour_discrete(name = "Type of sources") +
+     theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot4.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()

#Overall we see the emission of the types non-road, nonpoint and on-road has decreased by the years.
#The point source increased up until 2005 where it took a large decrease, but still above the total emission from 1999, so it actually increased overall. 


#Question 5
#How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

#create the relevant dataframes
baltiMotor <- subset(NEI, NEI$fips =="24510" & NEI$type =="ON-ROAD")
baltiMotorAGG <- aggregate(Emissions ~year, baltiMotor, sum)

#plot the sh*t
ggplot(baltiMotorAGG, aes(year, Emissions)) +
+   geom_line(col = "steelblue3") +
+   geom_point(col = "steelblue3") +
+   ggtitle(expression("Baltimore " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions by Year")) +
+   xlab("Year") +
+   ylab(expression(~PM[2.5]~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions"))

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot5.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()

#We clearly see how the emission has decreased with the years. Only a slight decrease from 2002-2005, but eventually it ended up below 100 in 2008. Started at around 350 in 1999.


#Question 6
#Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips==06037). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

baltLosAngelesMotors <- subset(NEI, NEI$fips %in% c("24510","06037") & NEI$type == "ON-ROAD")
baltLosAngelesMotorsAGG <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year + fips, baltLosAngelesMotors, sum)

ggplot(baltLosAngelesMotorsAGG, aes(year, Emissions, col = fips)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle(expression("Baltimore and Los Angeles" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions by Year")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = expression(~PM[2.5]~ "Motor Vehicle Emissions") ) +
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "City", labels = c("Los Angeles", "Baltimore")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

dev.copy(png,"plot6.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()

#In the overall picture, Los Angeles (LA) has seen a slight increase comparing 1999 to 2008. 
Baltimore has almost no emission in 2008 and has decreased every year since 1999. LA, on the other hand, has increased substantially from 1999 to 2005, and then taken a significant decrease to 2008.
