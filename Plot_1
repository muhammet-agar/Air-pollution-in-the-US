Question 1
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#Read file
summarySCC_PM25 <- readRDS("~/Downloads/exdata_data_NEI_data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")

#Aggregate the needed columns, Emissions and Year into a data frame
aggTotals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,summarySCC_PM25, sum)

#Create a barchart
barplot((aggTotals$Emissions)/10^6, names.arg = aggTotals$year, xlab="Year", ylab="pm2.5 Emissions (10^6)", main="Total pm2.5 Emissions for all US")

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot1.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()

Question 2
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (\color{red}{\verb|fips == "24510"|}fips=="24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

#aggregate the values for Baltimore, Maryland (fips == "24510")
baltimoreOnly <- summarySCC_PM25[summarySCC_PM25$fips=="24510",]
aggTotalsBalti <- aggregate(Emissions ~year, baltimoreOnly, sum)

barplot(aggTotalsBalti$Emissions, names.arg = aggTotalsBalti$year, xlab="Year", ylab="pm2.5 Emissions (Tons)", main="Total pm2.5 Emissions for Baltimore, Maryland")

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot2.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()



#Question 3
#



#Question4
#changed to more meaningful names
NEI <- summarySCC_PM25 
SCC <- source_pm25

#used grepl to everything with coal from SCC into new variable SCCcoal
SCCcoal <- SCC[grepl("coal", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case = T),]

#combined NEI coal and SCC coal 
NEIcoal <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCCcoal$SCC,]

#used aggregate to gather all relevant data
totalCoal <- aggregate(Emissions ~year+type, NEIcoal, sum)

#plot
 ggplot(totalCoal, aes(year, Emissions, col = type)) +
+     geom_line() +
+     geom_point() +
+     ggtitle(expression("Total US" ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Coal Emission by Type and Year")) +
+     xlab("Year") +
+     ylab(expression("US " ~ PM[2.5] ~ "Coal Emission")) +
+     scale_colour_discrete(name = "Type of sources") +
+     theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

#print the plot
dev.copy(png,"plot4.png", width=480, height=480)
dev.off()

#Overall we see the emission of the types non-road, nonpoint and on-road has decreased by the years.
#The point source increased up until 2005 where it took a large decrease, but still above the total emission from 1999, so it actually increased overall.
